              <p>Everyone gets hungry, get the pizzas and sandwiches at their place in no time.</p>
              <p>By offering fast and reliable delivery which the customer can track on their phone, FastCat
                has seen revenue growth of over 650% year on year. Restaurants who partner with us see their
                revenue increase by up to 30%, creating thousands of jobs in the restaurant sector.</p>
              <p>At FasCat, our values are at the core of everything we do. They guide how we work together
                and make decisions, whether it be recruitment or the evolution and development of our
                people, teams and products.</p>
              <h2 class="text-center"><span class="underline-word">Customers</span></h2>
              <p>FastCat is on a mission to transform the way customers eat. A key ingredient of our success
                is having the best selection of popular restaurants to choose from. Whether people want a
                pad Thai in the evening, a salad at lunch, or freshly scrambled eggs for breakfast - we’ve
                got it covered.</p>

              <p>By constantly innovating and expanding, we offer the best choice and convenience. Our aim is
                to bring great food direct to customers as fast as possible, in less than 30 minutes.</p>

                laboriosam.</p>
              <h2 class="text-center"><span class="underline-word">Driven by technology</span></h2>
              <p>FasCat was founded in the Ukraine and we are proud to export Ukrainian-borsh :) technology
                around
                the world. Our ‘Frank’ algorithm is based on powerful predictive technology that evaluates
                the
                most efficient way of distributing orders based on the location of restaurants, riders and
                customers.</p>
              <p>Machine learning helps to predict the time it will take to prepare a meal, helping to
                streamline the delivery experience. FastCat has already cut delivery time by 20%, meaning
                riders are able to complete more deliveries per hour and increase their earnings,
                restaurants are able to increase their sales, and – of course – customers get their food
                even faster.</p>
              <h2 class="text-center"><span class="underline-word">Working with our riders</span></h2>
              <p>FastCat is proud to offer well-paid, flexible work and our riders are at the heart of all
                that we do. Their hard work powers our growth, and without them we would be unable to bring
                our customers the best food on demand while helping great local restaurants to grow.</p>
              <p>FastCat cares about our riders, and that’s why we were the first on-demand company to call
                for an end to the trade-off between flexibility and security that currently exists in
                employment law. We want to work with Governments in all countries to make this happen</p>

              <h2 class="text-center"><span class="underline-word">Amazing restaurants, delivered</span></h2>
              <p>FastCat is passionate about food and bringing people evermore choice. There are amazing
                restaurants everywhere that we believe everyone should have access to.</p>
              <p>But FastCat’s mission is not only to make sure that the restaurants in your area are
                available to you when and where you want them - we want to go further and bring new
                restaurants to your area so you have even more choice of amazing food.</p>
              <p>FastCat’s Editions platform does exactly that: helping restaurants expand to new areas.
                Editions identifies the cuisines that people want but do not have access to locally and then
                invests in restaurants who excel in those foods to help them set-up in those local
                areas.</p>
              <p> We help restaurants to set up kitchens in new areas within just 8-12 weeks, without the
                upfront costs of a high-street premise. FastCat provides restaurants with data insights so
                that they know which cuisines will be popular in specific local areas - meaning restaurants
                grow faster and customers have wider choice.
              </p>
              <p>Whether it is a local restaurant looking to expand, street food entrepreneurs seeking new
                customers, or a restaurant wanting to launch a new menu, Editions is designed to support
                innovation.</p>
              <p>All this is what lies behind FastCat’s mission to bring customers a whole world of
                restaurant-quality food. Every consumer’s version of amazing is different, and our job is to
                ensure that they enjoy what they want, when they want it, where they want it.</p>
